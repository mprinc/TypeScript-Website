When working with [composite TypeScript projects](/docs/handbook/project-references.html), this option provides a way to declare that <span class='important'>you do not want a project to be included when using features like _find all references_ or _jump to definition_ in</span> an editor.

This flag is something you can use to <span class='definition'>increase responsiveness</span> in large composite projects.
