oneline: "Create sourcemaps for d.ts files."

<span class='definition'>Generates a source map for `.d.ts` files</span> which map back to the original `.ts` source file.
This will allow editors such as VS Code to go to the original `.ts` file when using features like <span class='definition'>_Go to Definition_</span>.

You should strongly consider turning this on if you're using project references.
