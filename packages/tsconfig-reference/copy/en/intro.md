## Intro to the TSConfig Reference

<span class='important'>A <span class='definition'>TSConfig file</span> in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript or JavaScript project</span>.
The TSConfig file can be either a `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`, both have the same behavior and the same set of config variables.

This page covers all of the different flags available inside a TSConfig file. It starts with an overview of every flag, then moves into the root attributes in the JSON file, then the `compilerOptions` which are the bulk of the options and wraps up with `watchOptions`.
